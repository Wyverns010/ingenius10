Truffle - 
A world class development environment, 
testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.

NPM -
Adapt packages of code to your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
Download standalone tools you can use right away.
Run packages

Webpack - 
module bundler that helps turn your code into static assets you can deploy to the web

MetaMask -
It is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today.
It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

Ganache - 
is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, 
develop your applications, and run tests.


Now that we've connected MetaMask to Ganache, you'll be taken to the accounts screen. Each account created by Ganache is given 100 ether. The first account should have less than the others because that account supplies the gas for smart contract deployment. Since you've deployed your smart contract to the network, this account paid for it.
